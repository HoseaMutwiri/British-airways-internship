# British-airways-internship
web scraping, data cleaning, data analysis


## The following was the task to be done in this project

### Scrape data from the web
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax.
The team leader wants you to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself.
You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your analysis. 


### Analyse data
Once you have your dataset, You will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. 
When the data is clean, you should perform your own analysis to uncover some insights.
It is recommended to complete this task using Python, however, you can use any tool that you wish. 


### Present insights
Your manager would like you to summarise your findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting.
You should create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from your analysis.
